# PRD: AI Cost & Insights Copilot

## Problem Statement
FinOps analysts need an intelligent, AI-powered platform to analyze cloud spend data, identify cost optimization opportunities, and answer natural language questions about cloud costs with actionable recommendations.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: FinOps Analysts, Cloud Cost Engineers, Finance Teams
- **Secondary**: Engineering Managers, DevOps Teams, C-suite Executives

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Natural Language Cost Analysis
**User Story**: "As a FinOps analyst, I want to ask questions like 'Why did my Azure spend jump 22% in May?' and get detailed analysis with sources and next steps."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Support natural language queries about cost data
- Provide detailed breakdowns by service, resource group, and time periods
- Include confidence scores and data sources
- Return 1-3 specific actionable recommendations

### 2. Automated Cost Optimization Detection
**User Story**: "As a cost engineer, I want the system to automatically identify idle resources and quantify potential savings."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Detect idle/underutilized resources (< 10% utilization)
- Identify tagging gaps causing cost allocation issues
- Provide monthly and annual savings estimates
- Prioritize recommendations by impact and confidence

### 3. KPI Monitoring & Trend Analysis
**User Story**: "As a finance manager, I want to track key cost metrics and trends across services and resource groups."

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Display monthly cost totals and trends
- Break down costs by service and resource group
- Show top cost drivers and anomalies
- Support filtering by time period, service, and tags

## Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Cost Savings Identified**: $50K+ monthly savings opportunities detected
- **Query Response Time**: < 3 seconds for 95% of questions
- **Recommendation Accuracy**: > 80% of recommendations actionable
- **User Adoption**: > 90% of FinOps team using weekly

### Secondary KPIs
- **Data Coverage**: > 95% of cloud resources properly tagged and tracked
- **System Uptime**: > 99.5% availability
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS > 8/10
- **Time to Insight**: Reduce manual analysis time by 70%

## Business Value
- **Cost Reduction**: Identify 10-15% cloud cost savings through optimization
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduce manual cost analysis time from hours to minutes
- **Better Governance**: Improve resource tagging and cost allocation accuracy
- **Proactive Management**: Shift from reactive to proactive cost management

## Technical Requirements
- Support 500-2K monthly billing records
- Handle 6+ months of historical data
- Process natural language queries in multiple formats
- Integrate with existing cloud billing APIs
- Provide REST API for programmatic access

## Assumptions
- Users have basic understanding of cloud services and FinOps concepts
- Cloud billing data is available in structured format (CSV/JSON)
- Organization has established cloud tagging policies
- Users prefer conversational interface over complex dashboards

## Out of Scope (V1)
- Real-time cost monitoring (daily batch processing acceptable)
- Integration with multiple cloud providers (single cloud focus)
- Advanced budgeting and forecasting features
- Role-based access control (basic security sufficient)
- Mobile application interface

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Quality**: Implement comprehensive data validation and quality checks
- **AI Accuracy**: Provide confidence scores and source citations for all responses
- **Performance**: Use caching and optimized queries for sub-3-second responses
- **Security**: Implement input validation and prompt injection protection
